    <div class="news"><h2>"WAT ARE NEWS," you ask?</h2><p>News is one of those words that you don't need to catatonically
       mutter to yourself several times for it to sound like nonsense.</p>
    <p>What the word actually means is even more disorienting. As much as I love consuming news and seeing all my favourite
       journalists live in concert, they've chosen probably the most chaotic medium of all time. Like trying to watch a 
       disjointed, infinite, nonlinear TV show shot by several different directors at the same time, all with competing 
       views on which characters we should be following, who the bad guy is, and whether people were "killed" or just 
       happen to have "died" somehow very close to a bombing.
    </p>
    <p>But most importantly, the flavour profile of news is overwhelmingly, mercilessly negative. Obviously, our 
      historical moment is somehwat to blame for that. We are reaching the climax of numerous crises, and the news does 
      a great job of reminding us of many of those â€” it's just not really allowed to propose any solutions.
