        Welcome to the world of Cloquaduct. This project is in its <a href="../outgrowths/outgrowths.html">Outgrowths</a>  phase. 
        The idea is to give some mythological form to the invisible processes of labour economics and class.

  <div class="textblockleft"><p>You can feel it right now, can't you? Even if you've been off the clock for days or maybe years, 
    that familiar socket of tension is always there, engraved somewhere between your back, brain and soul, 
    if you can remember where you left that. That's the Cloquaduct. Or part of it anyway.</p>
    <p>See these poor sods with clockwork chaos wreathed around their heads? They're on the clock, 
      getting their laborious life force — known as Toil — sucked out of them through what's called a Toilrig.
      It's the spectral mechanism that milks your Toil, keeps you stuck in your job, and throws you off the 
      socioeconomic cliff if you don't do what you're told. But these are just minute cogs and gaskets of the Cloquaduct.
      The first line of defense. That gnarly clock in the sky is the Cloquaduct. Or part of it anyway. It sucks up all the
       hours we spend in our lives working, or thinking about work.</p></div>

    <div class="textblockright"><p>The reason you can't see any of that is because your own devoted Thwartcog
       is busy wrapping your brain in Thwart. All the things that distract and disguise
        the truth about your life. Or rather, your Toil. That for the most part, it doesn't belong to you. 
      In a very real sense, most of the time, your will is not your own. Realizing this, and biting deep into it, 
    is the first step into the Cloquaduct.</p></div>
