      <h2>War Is Brewing</h2>
   <div><p>
    Need to make some graphics that tap into the current moment
     the TPS are having. What we know is that a 
     <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/why-torontos-police-union-could-soon-be-in-a-public-relations-war/article_50483f70-6c6e-11ef-b1bd-4fd92596b351.html">
      public relations war is brewing</a> after negotiations 
      between the Toronto Police Association and the police 
      board broke down and went to an arbitration process 
      expected to begin in November. The same weapons of mass
       propaganda that were used to pressure the city for that 
       additional $12 million in the 2024 budget will come out again, 
       possibly in even greater force, depending on how much money is on the line
      and to what extent public pressure will impact the arbitration process.</p>
